1 --- i)Standard features such as callorie tracking, tracking weigth over a period of time, storing height and using such metrics along with a quiz to predict body type(ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph).Also recommending some plans based on that and other common features..
      ii)Incorporating an ML model to determine and correct yoga poses.
      iii)Different already given packages on common goals such as weight loss, belly fat reduction, increasing athletic prowess etc.
      iv)Including mental health as a part of the package by recommending and quiz to determine his or her state.
      v)Sleep tracking for better health.
2 --- i)Atleast two types of credit points will be there based on perks earned by exercising and other things like daily login etc.(More detailing needs to be discussed on how each exercise will be rewarded and how exactly the type credit system will pan out.)
      ii)Making leaderboard.
      iii)Making different levels based on the primary point system.(Like many games which have gold and gems where gold is the primary currency and gems are a little more valuable and so they are the secondary currency, we would also have something like that).
3 --- Seamless collection of data from apps like google fit, healthyfy me etc but keeping all the reward system that our app. If possible even integrating the app with others which track health via smart watches.
4 & Gamification(since related points) --- i)Creating a facebook or insta page and giving shout out to the users who have achieved something like a great increase in the rate of exercise an user is doing etc etc.
